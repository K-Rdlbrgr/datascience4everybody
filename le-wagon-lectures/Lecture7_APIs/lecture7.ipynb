    "As a rule of thumb for Data Sourcing, you should get as close to the raw data as possible as a starting point for analysis. The data can be structures (csv, json, excel, SQl), unstructered (pdf, doc) or binary. If you want to get data online, you either find an accessible database or API, otherwise web scraping would also be a possibility."

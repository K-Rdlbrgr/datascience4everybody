# Data Science 4 Everybody

This repository contains all lectures and exercises from the Data Science 4 Everybody 9-weeks online program from Le Wagon. They offer free online courses and Coding Bootcamps for a variety of topices like DataScience, WEb Development, Growth Hacking, etc. and I really want to give a shoutout to the team for their excellent work!

You will find the class materials with some (hopefully) useful comments and all exercises here.
